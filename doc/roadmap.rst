Regarding cheating trc.me points
--------------------------------

The ability for users to fill in their own location is flawed. Google Gears
allows older devices and browsers to geolocate. That might be a better option.
Or, possibly, enable manual geolocation for users on a trust basis. Spot-check
manual location entry: Use multiple-choice questions about the location, or by
using images of nearby attractions.

Send managers alerts for scores > 10, and fast climbers. Liars are awarded
